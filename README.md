# Omnifood-Study-Project
Website of allegedly a well known restaurant with many branches and a quick delivery mobile app.

this project is written with only HTML & CSS.

Steps i did:

- Header - As you see, the flow is smooth and the colors are fitting great together.Its suppose to be welcoming so we have the main navigation and the logo first with beautiful background image while its used with 'linear-gradient' attribute to dark it out a bit and make the rest of the elements more clear to read and see.

- Features section - As you scroll a little down, you can see the main benefits of the business. In this section I learned about logo integration and the grid.css system.

- Favorite meals section - Here comes the boom. Let the surfers visualize the menu so good so it can almost be tasted. In this section i grouped 4 pictures in separate 'ul' with the 'figure' element for each 'li'. CSS wise, i used the element 'transform' with the 'scale' attribute, the 'opacity' element and then the 'transition' element for both.

- How it works - So after we tempted out potantial costumers, we need to show them how things work and how they can enjoy our services. Here i learned about 'first child', 'last child' and 'last of type' selectors. I used again the grid.css system but for two in this case.
